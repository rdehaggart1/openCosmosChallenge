# openCosmosChallenge
Considering a flat solar panel orbiting around the Earth, this Python code models the power generated by the panel over time. 

This implementation uses Python to plot an orbit around the Earth as defined by the user in terms of semi-major and semi-minor axes. The solar panel is animated to follow the plotted orbital trajectory, and to maintain it's zenith-pointing attitude (see [assumptions](#assumptions)).

# 2. Simplifying Assumptions
- The solar panel has only one face covered by solar cells
- The side of the solar panel with solar cells is always zenith-pointing
- The mass of the solar panel is negligible compared to the mass of the central body
- The gravitational influence of all bodies other than the central body is negligible
- The central body is assumed to be a perfectly homogeneous circle (i.e. the body can be assumed to have a centre of mass coincident with the centre of the body)
- The sun is distant enough for the ray lines to be considered parallel
